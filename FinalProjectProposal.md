# Final Project Proposal

## Summary

For my final project, I am going to build a website and put my last semester interaction project. In my previous project, I was trying to use YOLO to detecte the face and put it on the black and white photo, so the viewer could be the part of the show.

## Physical Parts
None

## Deconstruction

## Difficulty
1.Sometimes cannot precisely detecte the face.
2.Lighting and contrast after putting the face on the black and white photo
