# The Treachery of Sanctuary
## Description
"The Treachery of Sanctuary, currently touring the world with The Creators Project, is a large-scale interactive triptych: a story of birth, death, and transfiguration that uses projections of the participants’ own bodies to unlock a new artistic language."  
——Chris Milk

There are three large white panel frames in front of audiences. The shadows of the audiences will be captured. The shadow will be recreated as bird shape, then being projected on the white frames.
